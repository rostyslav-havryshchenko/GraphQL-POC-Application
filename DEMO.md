   - Demonstrate relationship loading (posts ‚Üí authors ‚Üí comments)
   - Show ellipsis text expansion

2. **Create Data Tab:**
   
   **Create User Form:**
   ```
   Name: "Demo User"
   Email: "demo@example.com"
   ```
   - Submit and show success message
   - Switch to Query tab to see new user appear
   - Point out form validation (try invalid email)
   
   **Create Post Form:**
   - Select the newly created user as author
   - Title: "Live GraphQL Demo"
   - Content: "This post was created during a live demonstration of our GraphQL POC application..."
   - Submit and show real-time updates
   
   **Create Comment Form:**
   - Select user and post
   - Content: "Great demo! GraphQL makes data fetching so elegant."
   - Submit and watch comment appear in posts list

### Part 4: Developer Experience (3 minutes)

**"Let's look at the developer experience and technical implementation."**

1. **GraphQL Playground** (new tab: http://localhost:4000/graphql):
   ```graphql
   query GetPostsWithComments {
     posts {
       title
       content
       author {
         name
         email
       }
       comments {
         content
         author {
           name
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Run query and show nested data loading
   - Demonstrate schema exploration
   - Show type safety and autocomplete

2. **Code Structure** (optional, if showing code):
   - TypeScript integration throughout
   - Custom React hooks for GraphQL operations
   - Automatic cache updates and refetching

2. **Data Visualization**: Show QuestDB's built-in charting for time-series data
3. **Error Handling**: Disconnect server to show error states and reconnection
4. **Mobile View**: Demonstrate responsive design on mobile device

## üõ†Ô∏è Demo Troubleshooting

### If Something Goes Wrong:

**Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check QuestDB status
docker ps | grep questdb

# Restart if needed
docker restart questdb-demo

# Re-seed database
cd server && npm run setup-db
```

**Server Issues:**
```bash
# Check server logs
cd server && npm run dev

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run type-check
```

**Client Issues:**
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
rm -rf client/node_modules/.vite
cd client && npm run dev
```
